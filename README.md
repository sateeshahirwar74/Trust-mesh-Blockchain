# Trust Mesh Blockchain

## 📌 Project Description
Trust Mesh Blockchain is a decentralized trust-verification framework built using Ethereum smart contracts. It enables participants to register as mesh nodes and accumulate trust scores based on peer validation. The project demonstrates how blockchain can create a distributed and tamper-proof trust system without central authorities.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To establish a transparent, secure, and decentralized mesh network where trust emerges from peer interactions—supporting IoT networks, distributed services, and peer-to-peer ecosystems.

## ⭐ Key Features
- **Node Registration:** Anyone can join the trust mesh by registering as a node.
- **Trust Rating System:** Participants can increase a node’s trust score.
- **On-Chain Transparency:** All data and events are publicly auditable.
- **Lightweight & Extensible:** Designed as a minimal base that can evolve into a complex reputation mesh.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add trust-decay algorithms to prevent stale reputation.
- Implement weighted trust graphs for more realistic scoring.
- Integrate verifiable off-chain proofs (e.g., interactions, performance).
- Build a frontend mesh explorer visualizing trust relationships.
- Add governance or staking mechanisms to discourage malicious behavior.
